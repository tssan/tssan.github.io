Summary: What it is, how it works, and how can you use it.
Status: draft


Just to remember: this is my understanding or/and interpretation of NFT and how it works.


# I. What is NFT

Non-fungible token - this is something you already heard a lot I assume. After watching and listening many smart people talking about NFT I would describe it in one sentence: "Digital form of signed proof of possesion of an asset stored in decentralized database (blockchain)." Ok I'm not sure if that is clearer definition but works for me :) It of course implicate same features that blockchain provides for coins and other tokens but I won't go into details about that, check part 1 of this series to learn more about basics.

Then next.. what does it mean in practice, how it works?

# II. How it works?

You should already heard of smart contracts. Those are the programs that are responsible of creating tokens (any kind of tokens, including NFT). So If I understand it correctly NFT creation and transactions looks like this:

    1. First we must have an asset (that can be almost anything that can be described in some unique way, eg. picture, document (digital or paper), realestate, song, ticket, poem, you name it..)

    2. Smart contract must be created that can create digital signed proof that is just a transaction with meta data that describes an asset. This do not attach an asset to the transaction (with physical it is just impossible, digital assets can take a lot of memory that would clog up network/blockchain). Then that smart contrat must be migrated into the blockchain (eg. Ethereum or Polkadot network).

    3. In this stage NFT can be created by smart contract and transaction will be added into the blockchain. Depending how program was constructed it can trigger many things like automatic payment of royalty - each time it is bought by anybody. That payment will be done automatically to the creator and of course to the person who sold it. The most common use case is just to have proof of ownership of something collectable like sport cards or digital paint.

    4. Value of NFT is dictated by people. If an NFT asset is something like ticket to the well known music band it will be much expensive than an image drawn by me (lol). That prices can change in time. If I gave up programming and start drawing.. who knows.. that image can get some value in time :)

    5. In pracitce buying and selling are just transactions so that requires knowledge about how wallets works. That's it.


Creator of the NFT decides about scarity. If it is an item from video game it probably will be single NFT. It also can be automaticaly generated in packs like 100 tickets for standup show.
